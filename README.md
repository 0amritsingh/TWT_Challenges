## TWT Challenges
TechWithTim (TWT) is a youtube channel where Tim has a Discord server in which there are **Weekly Coding Challenges**. So, I'm on a mission to complete maximum challenges form the server's channel.
***
###### I'm doing it in 2 ways:
1. **Beginning:** From the very first challenge on the server and as you can see I've made a folder for it.
2. **Currently:** mainly from April 8, 2024 (Challenge 195: Quasi-multiples, Part 1) to present.
> **Trash** is folder where I put the files that are less imoportant / useless / not a part of challenges / alternative code of the challenge.
